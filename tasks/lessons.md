# Lessons Learned — Caloura

<!-- Organized by topic. Graduated entries have rules in CLAUDE.md; detail kept here as reference. -->
<!-- When a lesson's rule is added to CLAUDE.md, mark it [Graduated] and trim to rule-only. -->

## AppKit / Cursor

### NSCursor.hide/unhide imbalance [Graduated]
- **Rule**: Guard `NSCursor.hide()` behind `window != nil` in `viewDidMoveToWindow()`. Use a boolean flag to balance hide/unhide exactly.
- **Context**: `viewDidMoveToWindow` fires on both add (`window != nil`) and remove (`window == nil`). Unguarded hide on removal creates a permanent imbalance.

### NSCursor.set() vs push/pop [Graduated]
- **Rule**: Use `NSCursor.crosshair.push()` to enter custom cursor mode, `NSCursor.pop()` to leave. Never use `.set()` alone — it is unreliable when the app is inactive (another app may own the cursor). Use `.set()` only inside `cursorUpdate(with:)` handler where AppKit expects it.

### macOS 26 tracking area: .activeAlways not supported for .cursorUpdate
- **Rule**: NEVER combine `.cursorUpdate` with `.activeAlways` in a single `NSTrackingArea`. macOS 26 does not support this combination. Split into two tracking areas: (1) `.cursorUpdate` + `.activeInKeyWindow` for cursor updates, (2) `.mouseMoved` + `.mouseEnteredAndExited` + `.activeAlways` for mouse tracking.
- **Mistake**: Single tracking area with `[.mouseMoved, .mouseEnteredAndExited, .cursorUpdate, .activeAlways]` caused `cursorUpdate(with:)` to never fire on macOS 26, so the crosshair cursor never appeared.
- **Fix**: Two separate tracking areas. `cursorUpdate` handler calls `handleCursorUpdate()` (uses `.set()`). Mouse handlers call `scheduleReprime()` (deferred pop+push cycle). Also make hovered overlay key window on `mouseEntered`/`mouseMoved` for multi-screen cursor ownership.

### NSApp.activate() cursor race [Graduated]
- **Rule**: Never use `disableCursorRects()` if you need `addCursorRect`. Use layered defense: (1) session-scoped push/pop, (2) addCursorRect in resetCursorRects, (3) cursorUpdate → .set(), (4) didBecomeActiveNotification + activeSpaceDidChangeNotification → scheduleReprime, (5) mouseMoved/mouseEntered → scheduleReprime.
- **Context**: `disableCursorRects()` kills ALL cursor rect processing. Each layer catches a different async timing edge case.

### NSApp.activate hides windows for LSUIElement apps
- **Rule**: Never use `NSApp.activate(ignoringOtherApps: true)` before showing capture overlays. Use `NSPanel` with `.nonactivatingPanel` style mask instead of `NSWindow`. The panel receives keyboard/mouse events without activating the app, so other apps' windows remain visible.
- **Mistake**: `NSApp.activate` was called before `showOnAllScreens`, causing macOS to hide all other application windows. The idle-state dimming (0.16 alpha black) previously masked this — removing dimming revealed the bare desktop wallpaper.
- **Fix**: `CaptureOverlayWindow: NSPanel` with `styleMask: .nonactivatingPanel`, `hidesOnDeactivate = false`, `canBecomeMain = false`. Remove `NSApp.activate` from area/fullscreen coordinators. Keep it only for window capture (SCK picker requires app activation).
- **Key insight**: A non-activating panel at `.screenSaver` level can become key and receive keyboard events (ESC) without the owning app being active.

### Bridge closures must survive window pool reuse
- **Rule**: When pooling/reusing `NSWindow` instances, do NOT nil bridge closures on `tearDown`/`release`. Bridge closures (selectionView → window) delegate through the window's optional callbacks, which are nil-safe. Nilling bridge closures breaks the forwarding chain on reuse.
- **Mistake**: `tearDownHandlers()` nilled both window-level callbacks AND selectionView bridge closures. On reuse, new window callbacks were set but the selectionView could no longer reach them.
- **Fix**: Only nil window-level callbacks in `tearDownHandlers()`. Bridge closures are permanent — they use `[weak self]` + optional chaining, so they no-op when window callbacks are nil.

### All capture modes must wire cursorController
- **Rule**: Every capture mode that shows overlay windows (area, fullscreen, scroll) must pass `sessionState.cursorController` and call `beginCrosshairSession()`/`endCrosshairSession()`. Don't rely on cursor rects alone.
- **Mistake**: Scroll capture called `CaptureOverlayWindow.showOnAllScreens()` without passing a `cursorController`, relying solely on cursor rects. After scroll capture failed, subsequent area captures lost their crosshair.

### 2026-04-19 — Cursor controller state must be recoverable [domain: swift]
- **Mistake**: Post-ship 2.4.0 crosshair stopped appearing entirely on a stateful basis — once broken, it stayed broken until app restart. Capture overlay still rendered, selection still worked, but the crosshair cursor was gone.
- **Root cause**: Two interlocking defects. (1) `CaptureOverlayWindowPool.release()`/`tearDown()` ordered windows out without calling `endCrosshairSession()`, leaving the shared controller's `cursorActive=true` and `pushed=true` after any bypass path (screen reconfiguration teardown inside `acquire()`, abnormal unwind). (2) `beginCrosshairSession()` had `guard !cursorActive else { return }` for double-begin idempotency, which silently trapped the controller in the leaked state forever — every subsequent capture's begin returned early, so no push, no reprime. (3) Compounding this: `AreaCaptureSessionCoordinator.present()` called `makeKeyAndOrderFront(nil)` *before* `beginCrosshairSession()`, so `becomeKey() → primeCrosshair() → scheduleReprime()` fired while `cursorActive` was false and was silently dropped — removing one defensive layer.
- **Rule**: Add an explicit `resetCursorState()` API to the cursor controller and call it on every coordinator entry (before `beginCrosshairSession`) and inside pool teardown paths as a safety net. Keep `beginCrosshairSession`'s idempotency intact — recovery is a separate, explicit operation. Log every silent no-op (`scheduleReprime`/`handleCursorUpdate` early-return) at debug level so future regressions become observable via `log stream --level=debug --predicate 'subsystem == "com.caloura.app" AND category == "Cursor"'`.
- **Confidence**: high (root cause for two prior cursor regressions — `b75a47d`, `099d206` — would have been caught earlier with this diagnostic + recovery pattern)

## State Machines / Recovery

### 2026-04-19 — Stateful flags require a recovery API + diagnostic log + defer-based clear [domain: swift]
- **Mistake**: Across five independent sites in Caloura — `CaptureCursorController.cursorActive`, `PermissionCoordinator.isShowingAlert`, `PermissionCoordinator.inFlightValidation`, `CaptureEnrichmentService` PII scan failure swallowing, `CaptureEntrypointService` empty-screens path — a stateful flag or in-flight slot could leak set-true on an abnormal control flow (cancellation, throw, screen reconfig teardown bypass, empty `screensProvider`) and silently break every subsequent operation. Symptoms surfaced post-ship: crosshair gone forever, no second permission alert ever, PII scan errors invisible, capture path appearing to "succeed" on zero displays.
- **Root cause**: Three antipatterns compounded.
  1. **Manual paired clear after the suspending await** — e.g., `isShowingAlert = true; await present(); isShowingAlert = false` — leaks on cancellation/throw because the clear is unreachable.
  2. **Idempotency guards (`guard !flag else { return }`) with no recovery escape hatch** — once leaked, every future caller returns early; the guard meant to prevent double-arm becomes a permanent trap.
  3. **Silent swallow of failure** — catching an error and returning a sentinel without (a) a discrete phase the UI can render and (b) a status message and (c) a debug log line. The user sees "nothing happened"; engineers have nothing to grep for.
- **Rule**: Three-part pattern, applied uniformly:
  1. **`defer { flag = nil/false }`** immediately after setting any in-flight slot or presentation flag, before any `await`. The cleanup runs on every exit path including cancellation. Applies to: `isShowingAlert`, `inFlightValidation`.
  2. **Explicit recovery API + diagnostic log** for every stateful guard. `resetCursorState()` for the cursor controller; an `inflight_repair` log line for the permission alert; a `PIIScanOutcome` enum (`.skipped` / `.scanned(_)` / `.failed`) instead of optional-with-silent-fallback for PII; an empty-overlays guard with status message + log + Bool return for `presentAreaCaptureCoordinator`. Recovery is a separate, explicit operation — do NOT remove idempotency from the happy path.
  3. **Discrete failure phase + status message + log** at every catch site. New `CapturePreviewPhase.piiScanFailed` is the canonical example: the UI gets a state to render, the user gets "PII scan unavailable — capture stored unscanned.", and engineers get a structured log with input dimensions and error.
- **Diagnostic floor**: every silent early-return logs at `.debug` under `subsystem == "com.caloura.app"`, with a category that names the subsystem (`Cursor`, `Permissions`, `Enrichment`, `CaptureEntry`). Future regressions become observable via `log stream --level=debug --predicate 'subsystem == "com.caloura.app"'` instead of requiring repro and bisection.
- **Confidence**: high (5 independent sites in one phase; the same pattern would have caught two prior cursor regressions and the post-ship 2.4.0 silent-PII-failure complaints)

## Permissions / macOS

### CGWindowList false positive on Sequoia [Graduated]
- **Rule**: Never use `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` as a permission check. `CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess()` is only a coarse passive signal; after an explicit Screen Recording grant attempt, use live ScreenCaptureKit validation as the authority.
- **Context**: Sequoia returns window metadata (names, owners) without screen recording permission.

### CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO strips TCC [Graduated]
- **Rule**: Only use `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` for CI/headless builds. Manual testing requires code signing for TCC permissions.

### Permission-repaired UI must only reflect live validation
- **Rule**: Do not show the repaired/completed Screen Recording UI until the current app copy reaches `.working`; `grantedNeedsValidation` is still an in-progress repair state.
- **Context**: Passive records and same-copy history can keep Screen Recording out of hard denial while macOS still needs one successful live validation. Showing “Permission repaired” first makes the next failed capture look contradictory.
- **Example**: `OnboardingView.handlePermissionStatus(...)` now routes `grantedNeedsValidation` back to the repair/validation step for completed users, and `AppDelegate.onboardingState(...)` maps only `.working` to `.completed`.

### Historical working state must not suppress a fresh permission request
- **Rule**: Never use stored “last working” path or fingerprint by itself to bypass `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess()`. Only an actual recent permission-request session may keep stale `CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess()` from forcing denial.
- **Context**: After `tccutil reset` or a removed Screen Recording record, relying on historical working metadata prevents Caloura from reappearing in System Settings because the app never re-requests permission.
- **Example**: `PermissionCoordinator.shouldTrustLiveValidationWithoutCoreGraphics(...)` now trusts only fresh request-session state or current-process live validation, while `takePendingCaptureResumeIfFresh()` recreates the recent request session in memory after the one automatic relaunch.

### replayd kickstart blocked by SIP on Tahoe (macOS 26)
- **Mistake:** `launchctl kickstart -k gui/<uid>/com.apple.replayd` was the core "silent repair" mechanism in 3 code paths. On Tahoe with SIP enabled, it fails with `Operation not permitted`.
- **Root cause:** macOS 26 tightened SIP restrictions on restarting system daemons. replayd restart is no longer reliable as a repair strategy.
- **New rule:** Treat replayd restart as best-effort, not a gating step. All callers must proceed to the next recovery action (alert, relaunch, etc.) when repair fails. Log `best_effort=true` for diagnostics.
- **Example:** `handleCapturePermissionFailure` now logs repair failure and proceeds directly to `publishExplicitFailure()` and alert presentation.

### SCK error classification must distinguish systemStoppedStream and missingEntitlements
- **Mistake:** Only `.userDeclined` was classified as permanent; `.systemStoppedStream` and `.missingEntitlements` fell through as generic transient errors. This caused incorrect behavior: system-stopped was incrementing the transient failure counter (wrong — it's recoverable without counting), and missing-entitlements was being retried (wrong — it's permanent).
- **Root cause:** Coarse boolean `isSCKErrorPermanent` only checked one code.
- **New rule:** Use an enum classifier (`ScreenCaptureFailureKind`) with 4 cases. `.systemStopped` = recoverable without incrementing failure counter. `.missingEntitlements` = permanent like `.userDeclined`. `.transient` = everything else, counts toward failure threshold.
- **Example:** `classifySCKError(_:)` returns `.systemStopped` for `SCStreamError.Code.systemStoppedStream` — no failure counter increment, not treated as permission denied.

### Concurrent permission validation must be serialized
- **Mistake:** Overlapping calls to `handleCapturePermissionFailure` / `revalidateAfterSettingsReturn` / `runUserInitiatedValidation` could interleave repairs and alerts, causing duplicate alerts or conflicting state.
- **Root cause:** No guard against concurrent validation flows. Rapid-fire capture failures or user-triggered validation during settings return polling could all run simultaneously.
- **New rule:** Use a single `inFlightValidation: Task<ScreenRecordingState, Never>?` gate. Callers that arrive while another validation is in-flight await the same task's result. Gate clears after completion so sequential calls run independently.
- **Example:** `async let first = coordinator.runUserInitiatedValidation(); async let second = coordinator.runUserInitiatedValidation()` — only one interactive check runs, both get the result.

### Tahoe System Settings deep links changed scheme
- **Mistake:** Used `com.apple.preference.security?Privacy_ScreenCapture` — the pre-Tahoe scheme. On macOS 26, this opens to the wrong pane or fails silently.
- **Root cause:** macOS 26 renamed the privacy pane identifiers.
- **New rule:** Use `com.apple.settings.PrivacySecurity.extension?Privacy_ScreenCapture` (and `Privacy_Accessibility`) for Tahoe deep links.
- **Example:** `"x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.settings.PrivacySecurity.extension?Privacy_ScreenCapture"`

### AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions shows the system prompt; AXIsProcessTrusted does not
- **Mistake:** Used `AXIsProcessTrusted()` which only checks — never prompts. Users had to manually navigate to System Settings when accessibility was denied.
- **Root cause:** `AXIsProcessTrusted()` is a passive check. `AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions` with `kAXTrustedCheckOptionPrompt: true` triggers the system prompt.
- **New rule:** Use `AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions` for first-denial accessibility prompts. Fall back to manual NSAlert + `openSystemSettings()` only if the user has already been prompted and still denied.
- **Example:** `let options = ["AXTrustedCheckOptionPrompt": true] as CFDictionary; return AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions(options)`

### kAXTrustedCheckOptionPrompt is not concurrency-safe in Swift 6
- **Mistake:** `kAXTrustedCheckOptionPrompt.takeUnretainedValue() as String` fails to compile in Swift 6 strict concurrency — the global is shared mutable state.
- **Root cause:** C globals imported into Swift aren't marked `Sendable`. Swift 6 flags them.
- **New rule:** Use the string literal `"AXTrustedCheckOptionPrompt"` directly instead of the C constant.
- **Example:** `["AXTrustedCheckOptionPrompt": true] as CFDictionary` (not `kAXTrustedCheckOptionPrompt.takeUnretainedValue()`)

## Swift Language

### Extension file splitting
- **Rule**: Change `private` → `internal` when moving methods to extension files. Stored properties must stay in main file. `@MainActor` extensions inherit isolation.

### String.flatMap iterates characters
- **Rule**: Prefer `guard let`/`if let` over chained `.flatMap` on String properties. `String.flatMap` is `Sequence.flatMap` (iterates characters), not `Optional.flatMap`.
- **Example**: `bid.flatMap { ... }` where `bid` is `String` → `bid` param is `Character`. Fix: `guard let bid = app?.bundleIdentifier`.

### OSLogMessage no + concatenation [Graduated]
- **Rule**: Never use `+` inside Logger calls. Extract to local `let` variable, then `logger.info("\(msg, privacy: .public)")`.

### SwiftLanguageMode.v6 requires swift-tools-version 6.0
- **Rule**: Don't add `.v6` to `swiftLanguageVersions` with `swift-tools-version:5.9`. The enum case is gated behind `@available(_PackageDescription 6)`.

## Testing

### Vision framework minimum image size
- **Rule**: `VNRecognizeTextRequest` requires at least 3x3 pixels. Use 10x10+ in tests.

### Method signature changes → grep all dirs [Graduated → MEMORY.md]
- **Rule**: When changing a method signature, grep both source and test directories for all call sites.

### Security fixes invalidate existing tests
- **Rule**: When tightening validation, check existing tests — they may depend on the insecure behavior. Update tests to use valid state, add a test for the rejection path.
- **Example**: S2-16 license bypass fix required adding `licenseKey` to the licensed test.

### Rate-limiting static state needs test isolation
- **Rule**: Make throttle timestamp `internal` (not `private`) and reset in `setUp()`.
- **Example**: `URLSchemeHandler.lastHandledDate = nil` in setUp.

### CGRect normalizes negative dimensions
- **Rule**: Test zero-size guards with `CGRect(width: 0, height: 0)`, not negative values. CGRect auto-normalizes negatives.

### Test temp file paths must include UUID
- **Rule**: Always include `UUID().uuidString` in temp file paths. Files persist between test runs and cause stale state.

### Pipeline statusMessage overwrite
- **Rule**: Don't assert on final `statusMessage` for intermediate errors — later stages overwrite it. Assert on a different signal (e.g., filePath is nil) or collect messages via sink.

## Persistence / Thread Safety

### KeychainHelper deliberately deprecated [Graduated]
- **Rule**: Use `HistoryCrypto.encrypt()` for sensitive persistence, not Keychain.

### DispatchQueue.sync must wrap entire critical section
- **Rule**: For check-then-set logic on shared state, wrap the entire method in `queue.sync {}`, not individual property accesses. TOCTOU race otherwise.
- **Example**: `HistoryCrypto.getOrCreateKey()` runs entirely inside `keyQueue.sync { }`.

### Debounced saves need synchronous flush on termination
- **Rule**: Any class with debounced persistence must expose `saveNow()`. `applicationWillTerminate` must call it.
- **Example**: `AppState.shared.saveHistoryNow()` + `AppSettings.shared.saveAllSettings()`.

### Don't cache failure results in lazy properties
- **Rule**: Only cache successful results. Return failure values without storing, so retries are possible.
- **Example**: `guard let data = try? ... else { return Data() }` — don't set `_pngData` on the failure path.

## Third-Party Libraries

### SPUUpdater delegate must be set at init
- **Rule**: `SPUStandardUpdaterController` takes its delegate only at init. Use a separate `NSObject` delegate proxy, pass at init, wire closures back.
- **Example**: `UpdateDelegateHandler` created first, passed to init, then closures connect to `UpdateManager`.

## Swift Concurrency

### Package.swift swift-tools-version for macOS 26
- **Rule**: macOS 26 requires `swift-tools-version:6.2` in Package.swift. Use `.swiftLanguageMode(.v5)` on targets to avoid Swift 6 strict concurrency errors while still targeting the new SDK.
- **Context**: `.macOS(.v26)` was introduced in PackageDescription 6.2. Earlier tool versions don't recognize it.

### withThrowingTaskGroup nil return types
- **Rule**: When a `withThrowingTaskGroup` closure returns an optional type (e.g., `String?`), annotate the outer variable with explicit type (e.g., `let response: String? = ...`) and use `nil as String?` for typed nil returns. Swift cannot infer optionality from bare `nil`.

### CGWindowListCreateImage removed in macOS 26
- **Rule**: `CGWindowListCreateImage` is unavailable on macOS 26+. Use ScreenCaptureKit (`SCShareableContent` + `SCScreenshotManager`) instead for screen/window capture.

## AI Features Architecture

### Detached task AI processing
- **Rule**: Extract AI post-processing (PII detection, embeddings, metadata) into file-scope helper functions, not class methods on @MainActor types. Avoids Sendable issues when called from `Task.detached`.
- **Example**: `detectPIIIfEnabled()`, `generateEmbeddingIfEnabled()`, `generateSmartMetadataIfEnabled()` as private file-scope functions in CapturePipeline.swift.

### SwiftLint function complexity
- **Rule**: When a pipeline function exceeds complexity limits after adding features, extract logical stages into helper functions. Each stage (PII, embedding, metadata) gets its own function. Use `// swiftlint:disable file_length` and `type_body_length` at file level for naturally large files.

## Process

### Documentation drift
- **Rule**: Archive stale planning material to `tasks/archive/`. Keep only current behavior in live docs. Update docs same-day when flows change.

### Never skip research steps before implementation
- **Rule**: When a plan has a research/validation step before coding (e.g., Codex calls, deep research), complete it first. Even a detailed plan can have wrong assumptions that research would catch.
- **Mistake**: Skipped Codex research calls in the permission fix plan and went straight to implementation. Research later revealed 4 additional gaps (replayd approval cache not cleared on TCC reset, SCK retry window too short, missing sckStateResetter in capture failure handler, blank image detection).
- **Key insight**: Research validates assumptions. The 0-10 second TCC propagation finding changed the retry window from 1.6s to ~7s. The Sequoia replayd `ScreenCaptureApprovals.plist` finding revealed the nuclear reset button was broken.

### 2026-06-10 — Pre-commit swift build fails only under sandboxed git commit [domain: process]
**Mistake:** Assumed hook failure was caused by the staged change; retried commit twice.
**Root cause:** Claude Code Bash sandbox + nested `swift build` resolves /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools SDK (macOS 27 / Swift 6.4) against Xcode 26's Swift 6.2.3 — SDK/compiler mismatch. Direct hook run and direct swift build pass.
**Rule:** If pre-commit swift build fails with "SDK is not supported by the compiler" while `swift build` passes, run the commit with explicit `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer SDKROOT=$DEVELOPER_DIR/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk` and sandbox disabled. Never --no-verify.
**Confidence:** low (1x)

### 2026-06-11 — Staged files ride along across branch switches [domain: process]
**Mistake:** Failed pre-commit attempts left files staged; switching branches and committing "one file" actually committed the whole stale index (PR #17 absorbed S1).
**Root cause:** git add survives branch switches; `git commit` commits the index, not the named files I had in mind.
**Rule:** After any failed commit + branch switch, run `git status` and `git diff --cached --stat` BEFORE the next commit.
**Confidence:** low (1x)
